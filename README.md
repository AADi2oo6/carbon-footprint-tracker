# carbon-footprint-tracker
An AI-powered Carbon Footprint Tracker with Django, IoT integration, and gamification to promote environmental sustainability.

<h2>Here’s the simple breakdown:</h2>

1. Track Everything: The app will collect data about a user's daily life—how they travel, what they eat, their electricity usage at home, and what they buy. This data can be entered manually, pulled from bills, or even collected in real-time from special "smart plugs" on their appliances.

2. Find the Patterns: This is where the "smart" part comes in. You'll use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze all this data. The AI will act like a detective, figuring out the biggest sources of a user's carbon footprint (e.g., "You use the air conditioner the most on weekday afternoons").

3. Give Smart Advice & Make it Fun: Based on its findings, the app will give personalized tips to the user on how to reduce their emissions (e.g., "Try pre-cooling your room an hour before peak electricity rates begin"). To keep users motivated, you'll add game-like features such as badges for achieving goals, challenges, and leaderboards to compete with friends or other communities.

Essentially, you are creating a complete ecosystem that doesn't just show users a problem (their carbon footprint) but actively helps them understand it, provides clear solutions, and makes the process of becoming more sustainable engaging and rewarding.
